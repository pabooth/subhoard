# Releasing

Releases are performed by a maintainer and follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Prepare the release

1. Ensure `main` is current and all required checks pass.
2. Move relevant entries from `CHANGELOG.md`'s `Unreleased` section into a
   section named `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`.
3. Update `VERSION` and `pyproject.toml` to `X.Y.Z`.
4. Open and merge a release pull request.

After the release pull request is merged, update local `main`, create the tag,
and push it:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

Maintainers using the shared multi-repository workspace may instead use its
`bump-version.sh` helper to automate the version update, pull request, merge
wait, and tag creation.

## Publish the release

Pushing tag `vX.Y.Z` starts the release workflow. It:

- verifies the tag, package metadata, and changelog agree;
- runs linting, tests, and source compilation;
- builds wheel and source distributions;
- installs and smoke-tests the wheel in a clean environment;
- creates a GitHub release using the changelog section as release notes;
- attaches the wheel and source distribution to the release.

Confirm that the GitHub release and both distribution artifacts were
published successfully.

PyPI publishing is not currently configured.
